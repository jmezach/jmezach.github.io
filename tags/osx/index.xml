      <description>If you’ve read my previous post you know that I have a keen interest in .NET Core. For the last two weeks I’ve been installing new RC2 builds on my machine almost on a daily basis to see if I could get something working and I’m glad to see that as of a couple of days ago things seem to be coming together. Obviously it still is a bit of a moving target but I feel like a lot of things are starting to settle.</description>
