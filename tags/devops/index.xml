      <description>About 2,5 years ago I was talking to my fellow team members about some of their challenges. At the time we had recently switched from TFS Version Control (TFVC) to Git, which obviously introduced quite a few changes in the way we worked. For example, we introduced pull requests as a mandatory step in the development flow in order to increase awareness and code quality. However, we found that some things that would need to happen for every pull request weren&amp;rsquo;t being done (or not done properly) which weren&amp;rsquo;t always caught by reviewers either.</description>
