      <description>Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been diving into the new build engine in TFS 2015 RC (RTM release is planned for 20th of July). While running a build,Â I got the following error message:
 Mixed mode assembly is built against version &amp;lsquo;v2.0.50727&amp;rsquo; of the runtime and cannot be loaded in the 4.0 runtime without additional configuration information.
 This got me puzzled for a while, especially since the build continued to run and it was doing what it was supposed to do, except that at the end the build turned red because of this error.</description>
