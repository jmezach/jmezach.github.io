      <description>In this post I would like to take a small break from my usual .NET Core related posts and talk about security. That&amp;rsquo;s because this week was quite a security minded week for me. For example, on Tuesday I attended an internal security bootcamp at Info Support. Security is becoming increasingly important so its also important to increase the awareness of security with everyone involved in software development.
But the bootcamp wasn&amp;rsquo;t the only security related thing I did this week.</description>
