      <description>First of all, it’s been a while since my last post here. I’ve busy working with SharePoint in the past few months and although there is plenty to write about SharePoint, a lot of it has already been written by other people, so I didn’t feel the need to write about it here. But lately I’ve found the time to experiment with Reactive Extensions again, which I’m quite fond of as you might remember from me previous post about the subject.</description>

      <description>For the past couple of weeks I’ve been looking into the Reactive Extensions framework. This resulted into a presentation for some of my colleagues about what Rx is, how it can be used and some of the cool stuff you can do with it. I delivered that presentation yesterday evening. Today I wanted to share the sources of the demo’s I’ve used during this presentation. You can download these from here: RxDemos.</description>
