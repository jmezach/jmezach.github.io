      <description>Last week I took to Twitter and asked if anyone of my followers would be interested in a session about .NET Core for developers that are using .NET Framework today.

That was a lot of fun, since I didn&amp;rsquo;t know much about Kubernetes before I started working on that, so I learned a lot in a relatively short amount of time, but I digress.</description>

But with .NET Core being open source there’s also another story to be told, namely that of extending and improving the platform itself through open source contributions. So when Karel Zikmund from the .NET Core team reached out on Twitter asking the community to help them fix bugs before the .</description>
