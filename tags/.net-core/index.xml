 Part 1: Introduction Part 2: Third party dependencies Part 3: Mechanics of porting Part 4: Deployment and packaging options  If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read any of the previous posts I recommend you do this now to get some context that I&amp;rsquo;ll be referring to in this post. If you have, continue on with the nitty gritty details of porting an app to ASP.</description>

      <description>This post is part of a series:
 Part 1: Introduction Part 2: Third party dependencies Part 3: Mechanics of porting Part 4: Deployment and packaging options  If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read the first post yet I suggest reading that first since it introduces the app that I&amp;rsquo;m porting and some of the reasons behind it.
Are my dependencies available on .NET Core? Most software these days consists of not just the code we write, but a lot of third party dependencies as well.</description>

      <description>Last week I took to Twitter and asked if anyone of my followers would be interested in a session about .NET Core for developers that are using .NET Framework today. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t really expecting all that much by sending that tweet, but with a little help from Immo Landwerth who&amp;rsquo;s on the .NET team, that tweet seemed to have sparked quite a bit of interest in such a session. Perhaps the announcements that ASP.</description>

      <description>It has been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve posted something here on my blog. That&amp;rsquo;s not because I haven&amp;rsquo;t done anything, just that I&amp;rsquo;ve been really busy lately with all kinds of things. For example, I&amp;rsquo;ve been delving into the container world and delivered a hands-on workshop with Kubernetes on Azure as part of the Global Azure Bootcamp 2018 back in April. That was a lot of fun, since I didn&amp;rsquo;t know much about Kubernetes before I started working on that, so I learned a lot in a relatively short amount of time, but I digress.</description>

      <description>As ASP.NET developers we’re fairly used to hosting our code inside Internet Information Services (IIS). However, since ASP.NET Core is cross-platform, hosting inside IIS isn&amp;rsquo;t always an option. For that reason, the hosting model for ASP.NET Core applications looks quite a bit different. Of course, we can still host our code in IIS, but we also have the option to use Kestrel and run as a standalone application.
This new hosting model is visible in code through the WebHostBuilder API from Microsoft.</description>

      <description>This week I’ve attended Microsoft’s Build conference in beautiful Seattle. It has a been a very busy week, but we had a lot of fun attending the different sessions as well as talking to some of the members on the various product teams.
Of course, during the week, my focus has been on .NET Core. I’ve attended most (if not all) of the sessions on .NET Core (and related technologies such as ASP.</description>

      <description>I’ve written quite a few blogs here on how you can use .NET Core in your applications and what to expect when developing for this new platform. But with .NET Core being open source there’s also another story to be told, namely that of extending and improving the platform itself through open source contributions. So when Karel Zikmund from the .NET Core team reached out on Twitter asking the community to help them fix bugs before the .</description>

      <description>In my previous blog post I talked about sharing .NET code across the various .NET platforms we now have within the .NET ecosystem (.NET Framework, .NET Core, Xamarin). In that post I also showed the new tooling within Visual Studio 2017 that enables (among other things) cross-targeting a lot easier than it was before. Since then two new versions of the new tooling experience for .NET projects have been released, and things have matured quite nicely.</description>

      <description>One of the key things that makes Xamarin such a great platform for developing mobile applications is that you can leverage your existing skills with C# and .NET and use them to create awesome Android and iOS apps. This also meant that you could take existing code written for .NET and use it in your Xamarin apps.
Of course, in the early days of MonoDroid and MonoTouch (before Xamarin was even a company) this wasn’t as easy as it is today.</description>

      <description>Unless you have been living underneath a rock you’ve probably noticed that yesterday, during Microsoft’s Connect() virtual event, .NET Core 1.1 was released. In addition ASP.NET Core 1.1 and Entity Framework 1.1 have been released. You can read up on the announcements in the following posts:
 .NET Core 1.1 - https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/11/16/announcing-net-core-1-1/ ASP.NET Core 1.1 - https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/11/16/announcing-net-core-1-1/ EF Core 1.1 - https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/11/16/announcing-entity-framework-core-1-1/  At first sight this doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem like much of a deal.</description>

      <description>In case you missed it, .NET Core RC2 has been released by Microsoft last week along with ASP.NET Core RC2 and a preview of the tooling. Lots of exciting new stuff that I highly encourage checking out.
Now that RC2 is out there I guess a lot more people will be checking it out and playing with it and there’s one topic that seems to confuse a lot of people. So I thought I’d write a blog about it to clear things up a bit.</description>

      <description>If you’ve read my previous post you know that I have a keen interest in .NET Core. For the last two weeks I’ve been installing new RC2 builds on my machine almost on a daily basis to see if I could get something working and I’m glad to see that as of a couple of days ago things seem to be coming together. Obviously it still is a bit of a moving target but I feel like a lot of things are starting to settle.</description>

      <description>As some of you might have seen on Twitter or Facebook I have attended Microsoft’s Build 2016 conference in San Francisco over the last week. It was an interesting experience with some good announcements, although to be honest I was expecting a little bit more. Then again Microsoft has become a lot more open about what they are doing which kind of takes the thunder away from these conferences. Free Xamarin, Azure Service Fabric generally available, Microsoft Cognitive Services and the Bot Framework are still great announcements though.</description>
