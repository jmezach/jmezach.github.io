      <description>Last week I attended Microsoft’s TechEd Europe conference in the RAI in Amsterdam. I had a great week. I’ve learned a lot of new stuff and I met with some interesting people. And since it has been a while since I’ve written anything on this blog I’d thought I’d do a little wrap-up of the conference and share with you some of my personal thoughts. I would like to stress that these are just my thoughts.</description>
