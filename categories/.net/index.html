      At my current employer, R&amp;R Workforce Management, we&rsquo;ve done a pretty big investment on Microsoft&rsquo;s SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) to manage our database changes. We made that decision when we migrated off of the Oracle database onto SQL Server which is quite a few years back now. At the time it was probably the most mature tool available that allowed us to version control our database changes much like we version controlled all our source code.

 Part 1: Introduction Part 2: Third party dependencies Part 3: Mechanics of porting Part 4: Deployment and packaging options  If you haven&rsquo;t read the first post yet I suggest reading that first since it introduces the app that I&rsquo;m porting and some of the reasons behind it.
Are my dependencies available on .NET Core? Most software these days consists of not just the code we write, but a lot of third party dependencies as well.

      Last week I took to Twitter and asked if anyone of my followers would be interested in a session about .NET Core for developers that are using .NET Framework today. I wasn&rsquo;t really expecting all that much by sending that tweet, but with a little help from Immo Landwerth who&rsquo;s on the .NET team, that tweet seemed to have sparked quite a bit of interest in such a session. Perhaps the announcements that ASP.

      It has been a while since I&rsquo;ve posted something here on my blog. That&rsquo;s not because I haven&rsquo;t done anything, just that I&rsquo;ve been really busy lately with all kinds of things. For example, I&rsquo;ve been delving into the container world and delivered a hands-on workshop with Kubernetes on Azure as part of the Global Azure Bootcamp 2018 back in April. That was a lot of fun, since I didn&rsquo;t know much about Kubernetes before I started working on that, so I learned a lot in a relatively short amount of time, but I digress.

      As ASP.NET developers we’re fairly used to hosting our code inside Internet Information Services (IIS). However, since ASP.NET Core is cross-platform, hosting inside IIS isn&rsquo;t always an option. For that reason, the hosting model for ASP.NET Core applications looks quite a bit different. Of course, we can still host our code in IIS, but we also have the option to use Kestrel and run as a standalone application.
This new hosting model is visible in code through the WebHostBuilder API from Microsoft.

      In my previous blog post I talked about sharing .NET code across the various .NET platforms we now have within the .NET ecosystem (.NET Framework, .NET Core, Xamarin). In that post I also showed the new tooling within Visual Studio 2017 that enables (among other things) cross-targeting a lot easier than it was before. Since then two new versions of the new tooling experience for .NET projects have been released, and things have matured quite nicely.

      One of the key things that makes Xamarin such a great platform for developing mobile applications is that you can leverage your existing skills with C# and .NET and use them to create awesome Android and iOS apps. This also meant that you could take existing code written for .NET and use it in your Xamarin apps.
Of course, in the early days of MonoDroid and MonoTouch (before Xamarin was even a company) this wasn’t as easy as it is today.

Now that RC2 is out there I guess a lot more people will be checking it out and playing with it and there’s one topic that seems to confuse a lot of people. So I thought I’d write a blog about it to clear things up a bit.

It was an interesting experience with some good announcements, although to be honest I was expecting a little bit more. Then again Microsoft has become a lot more open about what they are doing which kind of takes the thunder away from these conferences. Free Xamarin, Azure Service Fabric generally available, Microsoft Cognitive Services and the Bot Framework are still great announcements though.

      When .NET 3.0 was released we got Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and Windows Workflow Foundation (WF). These were great technologies, but they would have been even greater if they were used together. Unfortunately, Microsoft decided not to include this for .NET 3.0. However, with the release of .NET 3.5 we got the WCF Send and Receive activities that you can use in your workflows in order to implement a WCF service contract by using a workflow.

We haven&rsquo;t been able to find a mention of this bug in the release notes, but we had a small application that showed the bug was there, so we tested it on our development machine which were using the service packs and then on a test server which didn&rsquo;t have the service pack installed and it showed that it was working find on our development machines, but it didn&rsquo;t work on our test servers.

      Today I was working on a bit of workflow we have in our project. We&rsquo;ve written a couple of activities to handle some of the processing done in our application (such as sending out emails at a specified point in time). These activities have been working quite well, but they lacked some kind of validation on required properties or how they were used in the workflow. So I was assigned the task to implement some of that stuff.

        Silverlight 1.0 RTM

      As my colleague Willem mentioned, Microsoft has finally released Silverlight 1.0. I find it amazing how fast this technology has gone. A year ago nobody heard of Silverlight, and now there is a first release. Although I&rsquo;m quite impressed by the features of Silverlight 1.0, I think that Silverlight 1.1 has far more potential. Having the power of C# inside the browser, that must be awesome. It is going to open up a lot of possibilities for a richer end-user experience, while a lot of the advantages of web applications are still there.

      This week I&rsquo;ve been spending some more time on this WCF issue I&rsquo;ve blogged about before. Unfortunately I still don&rsquo;t have a solution for the problem, and I doubt that I will ever find one. However, I did find some interesting things I thought I should blog about.
I found out that the bug isn&rsquo;t in the actual serialization process, but rather in the generation of the code that is supposed to do the actual serialization.

        Possible WCF Serialization Issue?

      As I was writing in my previous post there is something interesting going on in WCF. But before I go into the details, let me explain the situation.
There are 3 services in our project, one business service, one process service and one front end. We use WCF to communicate between these services. We are using basicHttpBinding and we have a central set of XSD schema&rsquo;s from which we generate code using the svcutil tool provided with .
